# Space2020
It's a multiplayer game that allows users to control a first person astronaut character to explore spaceship crash sites on the moon.

Players can visit one of two crash sites and upon arrival they will receive a text message using Twilio API with additional information about the spaceship. 

In addition there is implemented simple AI that will listen to commands being said over microphone and uses voice recognition to detect speech, and based on fixed list answers the players questions. Each player can explore the game at it's own pace and trigger events simultaneously.
